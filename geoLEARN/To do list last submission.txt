- change the weighting of the classes (same influence for each class, blanced, ...) or use SMOTE to increase the size of less-populated classes
- add or remove engineered features by looking at what others have done.
- one vs all
- compare well tuned RF, Gradient Boosting and Extremely Randomized Trees
- add a second layer of classification using the predict_proba: take the classification with high probability as good and try to reclassify the others with new variables: probability for each class, distance to other classes (from high proba classification)...
- replace missing values with RF prediction for PE
